#USED HARDWARE
There is a list of used hardware:
* Raspberry Pi 2 model B+
* 3x microSDHC card 8GB
* 1.2A Micro USB Power Supply
* Wi-Fi Adapater TP-LINK TL-WN725N
* PIR Senzor HC-SR501
* Pi Camera module V2

I used three micro card because i didnt want delete any data from one system. And its easier just swap card with system then reinstallating each system.
