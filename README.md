# Thesis
Construction PhotoTrap on Raspberry Pi.
# Important Information
There is a Summary from my thesis on *University of South Bohemia in Czech Republic*. All hardware was provided by University. It is a little guide for those who likes Raspberry Pi projects. 

In this thesis i used three OS Raspbian, Ubuntu Mate and Fedberry.

# Installation
I will describe how to Install PhotoTrap on these operating systems.

### [Raspbian](https://github.com/DanielSvab/Thesis/blob/master/Installation%20Raspbian.md)

Release images can be downloaded from:
- Repository (raspbian.org): <a href="http://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/dists/">HERE</a>
- Or on Raspberry official sites: <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">HERE</a>

### [Ubuntu MATE](https://github.com/DanielSvab/Thesis/blob/master/Installation%20Ubuntu.md)

Image for this system can be downloaded from:
- Ubuntu MATE sites:<a href="https://ubuntu-mate.org/raspberry-pi/"> HERE</a>

Actuall version of working system is 16.04. The installation obtains GNU like Raspbian. For insallation is needed monitor, keyboard, mouse.

### [FedBerry](https://github.com/DanielSvab/Thesis/blob/master/Installation%20FedBerry)

I used quide from GitHub [Fedberry](https://github.com/fedberry/fedberry) repository. 
You can choose witch type of installation you want.

##Summary

PhotoTrap was tested on every OS. Tested was how far away can be Raspberry from Active Point. And how often get some errors, 
failure due to overloading. At the end of testing i summarized pros and cons. And the best system for this project is Raspbian (wheezy), cause of his popularity, great comunity, often updates. The main attribute is higher swiftness then other systems in GUI or in terminal.
